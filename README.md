and I will put my REVENGed files of GGMM, I call it MMGG project :3

I already mailed initial and original programmer and recieved no answers, metdata shows he's been offline for like 15 years! I hope he's still alive!

Ok... It's my first time that I wana back engineer sth, never done it before!

Alright here we are, in a directory with following files:

```shell
┌──(user㉿dhcppc4)-[~/Desktop/books/MMGG]
└─$ ls
GGMM.exe  GGMM.txt  GTAINTERFACE.dll
    
```

I knwo that de pogram was created using Delfi lang, and I know nothing of Delfi, but I think it' safe ti stick into standard procedure, Which is scanning the file types:3

```shell
┌──(user㉿dhcppc4)-[~/Desktop/books/MMGG]
└─$ file * 
GGMM.exe:         PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows, UPX compressed
GGMM.txt:         ASCII text, with very long lines (376), with CRLF line terminators
GTAINTERFACE.dll: PE32 executable (DLL) (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows
     
```
now what does it tell us?! A lot to go abviously:3
